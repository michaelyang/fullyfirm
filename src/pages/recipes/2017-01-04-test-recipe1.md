ingredients:
  - item: 1/2 small head cabbage
    description: Finely shredded (about 4 packed cups; 14 ounces; 400g)
  - item: scallions
    description: Thinly sliced, dark green parts reserved separately
  - item: katsuobushi
    amount: '1/2 ounce (15g)'
  - item: yamaimo
    amount: '1/4 pound (120g)'
    description: Peeled and grated on the smallest holes of a box grater
  - item: 2 large eggs
  - item: 1/2 cup cold water or dashi
  - item: 3/4 cup all purpose flour
  - item: 8 to 10 thin slices uncured pork belly
  - item: 2 Tbsp (30ml) vegetable oil
  - item: Ao-nori, okonomiyaki sauce, and Kewpie mayonnaise, for serving
directions:
  - Combine cabbage, scallion whites and half of greens, half of beni-shoga, 3/4 of katsuobushi, yamaimo, eggs, and water (or dashi) in a large bowl. Sprinkle with flour. Stir with a fork and beat heavily until a thick batter with plenty of bubbles forms. Set aside.
  - If using pork belly, cover the bottom of a 10-inch nonstick skillet with pork belly and set over medium heat. Add okonomiyaki mixture and spread into an even layer with a fork. If not using pork belly, heat vegetable oil in skillet over medium heat until shimmering. Add okonomiyaki mixture and spread into an even layer with a fork.
  - Cover and cook, shaking pan occasionally, until bottom layer is crisp and well browned, about 10 minutes, lowering heat as necessary if cabbage threatens to burn.
  - To flip, drain off any excess fat, then, working over a sink and holding the lid tightly against pan with a pot holder, flip entire pan and lid over so that okonomiyaki transfers to pan lid. Remove pan, then carefully slide okonomiyaki off lid and back into pan, browned side up.
  - Return to heat, cover, and continue to cook, shaking gently, until both sides are browned and okonomiyaki is not runny but still custardy and tender in the center, about 8 minutes longer. Transfer to a serving platter, pork side up.
  - Drizzle with okonomiyaki sauce and mayonnaise; sprinkle with ao-nori, remaining beni-shoga, remaining katsuobushi, and remaining scallion greens; and serve immediately off of a communal plate.
