  Okonomi means "how you want it." This is just how I like my okonomiyaki. You can add whatever you'd like once you get the base down. I use an 8-inch pan to make it personal-sized. Feel free to use larger pans, but cooking time will have to increase.

ingredients:
  - item: 1/2 medium head cabbage (400g)
    description: Finely chopped (I prefer this over shredded).
  - item: 2/3 cup all purpose flour
  - item: 1 cup dashi
  - item: 2 large eggs
    description: Beaten
  - item: 1/6 pound (75g) yamaimo
    description: Peeled and grated
  - item: 2 scallions
    description: Thinly sliced, keep white and green parts separate.
  - item: 1/4 ounce katsuobushi
  - item: However much pork belly you want
    description: Thinly sliced, bite size
  - item: Vegetable oil
  - item: Okonomiyaki sauce
  - item: Kewpie mayonnaise
directions:
  - Place the finely chopped cabbage in a large bowl. Sprinkle flour on top. Add the scallion whites, grated yamaimo, eggs, and dashi. Mix the batter well. The consistency should be slightly watery. This mixture can sit upto two days if air-tight.
  - Add around 1 to 2 Tbsp of oil to a 8-inch nonstick pan. Cover the bottom with pork belly and set over medium heat. Add the prepared batter and spread it evenly.
  - Cover the pan and let it sit for about 6 minutes. The time varies a lot depending on the fire/pan size/thickness/pork belly slices. You should be able to see the bottom edges browned from above. Adjust accordingly.
  - Uncover, tip out and save the excess oil from the pan. Flip the okonomiyaki, either using a spatula or flipping it in the air. You can also close the lid, flip the pan over, and slide the okonomiyaki off the lid onto the pan again, but you must make sure you have no oil remaining before.
  - Add oil back down the side of the pan, adding more if necessary. The okonomiyaki will have burned spots without enough oil. Move the pan around a little to coat the bottom layer with oil. Turn the fire back onto medium, and cook for 4 more minutes until the other side is crispy.
  - Transfer to a plate. Drizzle with okonomiyaki sauce and Kewpie mayo. Sprinkle katsuobushi and scallion greens.
